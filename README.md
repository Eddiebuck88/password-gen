# password-gen

# Description
A password generator is a software tool or program designed to create unique and random passwords for users. These passwords are usually strong and secure, and they are difficult for hackers to guess or crack. Password generators can generate passwords of various lengths and complexity, and they often allow users to include or exclude certain character sets, such as numbers, letters (both upper and lowercase), and special characters. By using a password generator, users can ensure that their passwords are secure and not easily guessable, reducing the risk of their accounts being hacked or compromised. Password generators are particularly useful for creating strong passwords for online accounts, such as email, social media, and online banking.
